# mentalhealthcare

A Flutter project that utilizes Gemini API's to provide AI-powered, personalized guidance and counselling.

## Description
My app is a mental health platform designed to provide personalized support, resources, and community engagement
for users managing their mental well-being. The app features secure user authentication, personalized profiles, 
AI-powered chatbots, and access to a comprehensive resource library, all aimed at improving mental health.

I integrated the Gemini API to enhance the app's AI capabilities, particularly in the chatbot feature.
The Gemini AI offers intelligent responses to user queries, provides mindfulness exercises, and suggests
personalized mental health tips based on user input. Additionally, Gemini AI generates daily motivational
quotes tailored to the userâ€™s selected mood, creating a more personalized and supportive experience.
The API also powers the app's insights feature, analyzing user data to offer trends and progress reports,
further guiding users on their mental health journey.

This integration ensures that the app not only serves as a tool for mental health management but also as a 
companion that adapts to the user's needs, making the support they receive both timely and relevant.
